# BitAdjacenyGraph-Git


This solution demonstrates the BitAdjacencyGraph class.  That class store, manipulates,
and traverses a graph.  It uses a Bit Adjacency Matrix to store the edge information.
In that matrix, the connections between vertices are stored as zero or one bits in a
byte sequence.  This saves storage space.
